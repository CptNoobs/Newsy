# Sample News Globe

This project places a handful of sample news headlines on a 3D globe. It was adapted from the original "globe of extremes" demo and uses the ArcGIS API for JavaScript.

The file `sample-news.geojson` contains example articles with coordinates for New York City, London, and Tokyo. No external news APIs are required.

To view the globe, serve the directory with any static web server and open `index.html` in your browser.
