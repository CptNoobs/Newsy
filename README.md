# Sample News Globe

This project places sample news headlines on a 3D globe. It was adapted from the original "globe of extremes" demo and uses the ArcGIS API for JavaScript.

The file `sample-news.geojson` contains a few example locations and their headlines. Click on the orange pins to read the title, summary and link stored in the GeoJSON file. No external news service is required.

To view the globe, serve the directory with any static web server and open `index.html` in your browser.
